    Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO)

    This is Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO),
    an evolution of the Tail-f Network Control System (NCS).
    Tail-f was acquired by Cisco in 2014. The product has been enhanced
    and forms the base for Cisco NSO.

    Note that the terms 'ncs' and 'tail-f' are used extensively in file
    names, command-line command names, YANG models, application
    programming interfaces (API), etc.

-----------------

See the NSO Installation Guide.

2. NSO Documentation
--------------------

2.1 Documentation Overview
--------------------------

The NSO Documentation set is split into different books depending on
the target audience.

* NSO Installation Guide
  - How to install NSO.

* NSO Getting Started
  - An introduction to NSO from an end-user perspective.

* NSO User Guide
  - Describes all features in NSO from an end-user perspective.

* NSO CDM Migration Guide
  - Explains how to migrate NSO with Common Data Models
    (CDM) functionality.

* NSO Administration Guide
  - How to configure and monitor NSO. For system administrators.

* NSO Development Guide
  - Explains the NSO APIs, and how to extend the NSO functionality.
    Special focus on how to develop service applications.

* NSO NED Developers Guide
  - Explains how to add support for a new device type to NSO be
    developing a Network Element Driver, NED.

* NSO Northbound APIs
  - This document shows how to integrate NSO to a northbound system
    using the available APIs, such as NETCONF, REST, and SNMP.

* NSO Web UI Developers Guide
  - It is common to expose service applications in a dedicated
    self-service. This shows how to build a custom Web UI using the
    JSON RPC.

* NSO Layered Service Architecture
  - This document describes how to design massively large and scalable
    NSO applications.

* NSO Manual Pages
  - All NSO manual pages in one book.

2.2 Reference Documentation
---------------------------

* Java API
  - Complete JavaDoc for all Java APIs.

* Erlang API
  - Documentation for the Erlang API.

* Python API
  - The NSO Python API Documentation.

* confd_lib(3) in NSO Manual Pages
  - The C API Documentation.

2.3 Reading paths for different target groups
---------------------------------------------

 NSO User

  This path is for for users of the NSO systems. Users are network
  engineers that uses NSO to perform device configuration and service
  activation tasks.

  1) NSO Getting Started
  2) NSO User Guide


 NSO Administrator

  NSO administrators manages the installation and monitoring of
  NSO. Target audience is system administrators with Unix skills who
  are used to manage software installations on Unix systems.

  1) NSO Installation Guide
  2) NSO Getting Started
  3) NSO Administration Guide


 NSO Developer

  NSO Developers are skilled Java/Python developers that are given
  the task of extending NSO with support for specific service types
  like VPNs etc. Developers need to have good Unix knowledge,
  and be experience Java/Python programmers. It is a prerequisite
  to know the YANG data-modeling language.

  2) NSO Getting Started
  3) NSO User Guide
  4) NSO Developers Guide
  5) Java API
  6) Python API


 NSO Northbound Integrator

  NSO is normally integrated south of order-managers, portals, service
  catalogs or similar. This guide shows how to use the NSO northbound
  APIs to do these kind of integration. Programming and scripting
  skills are required. The integrator must also know YANG and the
  specific YANG models in the deployment.

  1) NSO Getting Started
  2) NSO Northbound APIs


 NSO Web UI Developer

  This guide shows how to build a specific Web UI for NSO. JavaScript
  and JSON-RPC knowledge is a prerequisite-requisite. The developer
  must also know the YANG data-modeling language.

  1) NSO Installation Guide
  2) NSO Getting Started
  3) NSO Web UI Developers Guide


 NSO NED Developer

  In most of the cases customers gets the Network Element Drivers,
  NEDs, from Cisco. The NEDs enables NSO to configure a specific
  device. In some cases developers can develop their own NEDs. NED
  developers need to be experienced in YANG and Java. They also need
  to have deep knowledge on the specific device interface.
