.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command provides a convenient way of loading and saving all or parts of the configuration in different formats\&. It can be used to initialize or restore configurations as well as in CLI commands\&.
.PP
If you run
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
without any options it will print the current configuration in XML format on stdout\&. The exit status will be zero on success and non\-zero otherwise\&.
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Debug flag\&. Add more to increase debug level\&. All debug output will be to stderr\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR
.RS 4
Measure how long the requested command takes and print the result on stderr\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F\fR \fIformat\fR
.RS 4
Selects the format of the configuration when loading and saving, can be one of following:
.PP

.RE

.PP
\fB\-H\fR
.RS 4
Hide all hidden nodes\&. By default, no nodes are hidden unless
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
has attached to an existing transaction, in which case the hidden nodes are the same as in that transaction\*(Aqs session\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-U\fR
.RS 4
Unhide all hidden nodes\&. By default, no nodes are hidden unless
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
has attached to an existing transaction, in which case the hidden nodes are the same as in that transaction\*(Aqs session\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR \fIuser\fR, \fB\-g\fR \fIgroup\fR \&.\&.\&., \fB\-c\fR \fIcontext\fR
.RS 4
Loading and saving the configuration is done in a user session, using these options it is possible to specify which user, groups (more than one
\fB\-g\fR
can be used to add groups), and context that should be used when starting the user session\&. If only a user is supplied the user is assumed to belong to a single group with the same name as the user\&. This is significant in that AAA rules will be applied for the specified user / groups / context combination\&. The default is to use the
\fBsystem\fR
context, which implies that AAA rules will
\fInot\fR
be applied at all\&.

If the environment variables
\fBNCS\fR\fB_MAAPI_USID\fR
and
\fBNCS\fR\fB_MAAPI_THANDLE\fR
are set (see the ENVIRONMENT section), or if the
\fB\-i\fR
option is used, these options are silently ignored, since
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
will attach to an existing transaction\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR
.RS 4
Instead of starting a new user session and transaction,
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
will try to attach to the init session\&. This is only valid when NSO is in start phase 0, and will fail otherwise\&. It can be used to load a
\(lqfactory default\(rqfile during startup, or loading a file during upgrade\&.
.RE
.SH "SAVE CONFIGURATION"
.PP
By default the complete current configuration will be output on stdout\&. To save it in a file add the filename on the command line (the
\fB\-f\fR
option is deprecated)\&. The file is opened by the
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
utility, permissions and ownership will be determined by the user running
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR\&. Output format is specified using the
\fB\-F\fR
option\&.
.PP
When saving the configuration in XML format, the context of the user session (see the
\fB\-c\fR
option) will determine which namespaces with export restriction (from
tailf:export) that are included\&. If the
\fBsystem\fR
context is used (this is the default), all namespaces are saved, regardless of export restriction\&. When saving the configuration in one of the CLI formats, the context used for this selection is always
\fBcli\fR\&.
.PP
A number of options are only applicable, or have a special meaning when saving the configuration:
.PP
\fB\-f\fR \fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
Filename to save configuration to (option is deprecated, just give the filename on the command line)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-W\fR
.RS 4
Include leaves which are unset (set to their default value) in the output\&. By default these leaves are not included in the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S\fR
.RS 4
Include the default value of a leaf as a comment (only works for CLI formats, not XML)\&. (Corresponds to the
\fBMAAPI_CONFIG_SHOW_DEFAULTS\fR
flag)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR \fIkeypath\fR
.RS 4
Only include the configuration below
\fIkeypath\fR
in the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P\fR \fIXPath\fR
.RS 4
Filter the configuration using the
\fIXPath\fR
expression\&. (Only works for the XML format\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR
.RS 4
Include operational data in the output\&. (Corresponds to the
\fBMAAPI_CONFIG_WITH_OPER\fR
flag)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-O\fR
.RS 4
Include
\fIonly\fR
operational data, and ancestors to operational data nodes, in the output\&. (Corresponds to the
\fBMAAPI_CONFIG_OPER_ONLY\fR
flag)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR
.RS 4
Include only data stored in CDB in the output\&. (Corresponds to the
\fBMAAPI_CONFIG_CDB_ONLY\fR
flag)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M\fR
.RS 4
Include NCS service\-meta\-data attributes in the output\&. (Corresponds to the
\fBMAAPI_CONFIG_WITH_SERVICE_META\fR
flag)\&.
.RE
.SH "LOAD CONFIGURATION"
.PP
When the
\fB\-l\fR
option is present
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
will load all the files listed on the command line \&. The file(s) are expected to be in XML format unless otherwise specified using the
\fB\-F\fR
flag\&. Note that it is the NSO daemon that opens the file(s), it must have permission to do so\&. However relative pathnames are assumed to be relative to the working directory of the
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
command \&.
.PP
If neither of the
\fB\-m\fR
and
\fB\-r\fR
options are given when multiple files are listed on the command line,
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
will silently treat the second and subsequent files as if
\fB\-m\fR
had been given, i\&.e\&. it will merge in the contents of these files instead of deleting and replacing the configuration for each file\&. Note, we almost always want the merge behavior\&. If no file is given, or "\-" is given as a filename,
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
will stream standard input to NSO \&.
.PP
\fB\-f\fR \fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
The file to load (deprecated, just list the file after the options instead)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR
.RS 4
Merge in the contents of
\fIfilename\fR, the (somewhat unfortunate) default is to delete and replace\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-j\fR
.RS 4
Do not run FASTMAP, if FASTMAPPED service data is loaded, we sometimes do not want to run the mapper code\&. One example is a backup saved in XML format that contains both device data and also service data\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR
.RS 4
Only load data to CDB inside NCS, do not attempt to perform any update operations towards the managed devices\&. This corresponds to the \*(Aqno\-networking\*(Aq flag to the commit command in the NCS CLI\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR
.RS 4
Lax loading\&. Only applies to XML loading\&. Ignore unknown namespaces, attributes and elements\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4
Replace the part of the configuration that is present in
\fIfilename\fR, the default is to delete and replace\&. (Corresponds to the
\fBMAAPI_CONFIG_REPLACE\fR
flag)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR
.RS 4
When loading configuration in \*(Aqi\*(Aq or \*(Aqc\*(Aq format, do a commit operation after each line\&. Default and recommended is to only commit when all the configuration has been loaded\&. (Corresponds to the
\fBMAAPI_CONFIG_AUTOCOMMIT\fR
flag)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR
.RS 4
When loading configuration do not abort when encountering errors (corresponds to the
\fBMAAPI_CONFIG_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR\fR
flag)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR
.RS 4
Delete entire config before loading\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR \fIkeypath\fR
.RS 4
Delete everything below
\fIkeypath\fR
before loading the file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR
.RS 4
Accept but ignore contents in the file which is operational data (without this flag it will be an error)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-O\fR
.RS 4
Start a transaction to load
\fIonly\fR
operational data, and ancestors to operational data nodes\&. Only supported for XML input\&.

\fBNCS\fR\fB_MAAPI_USID\fR, \fBNCS\fR\fB_MAAPI_THANDLE\fR
.RS 4
If set
\fBncs_load\fR
will attach to an existing transaction in an existing user session instead of starting a new session\&.
.sp
These environment variables are set by the NSO CLI when it invokes external commands, which means you can run
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
directly from the CLI\&. For example, the following addition to the
<operationalMode>
in a clispec file (see
\m[blue]\fBclispec(5)\fR\m[])
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<cmd name="servers" mount="show">

      <osCommand>ncs_load</osCommand>
          <args>\-F j \-p /system/servers</args>
    </exec>
  </callback>
</cmd>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
will add a
\fBshow servers\fR
command which, when run will invoke
\fBncs\fR\fB_load \-F j \-p /system/servers\fR\&. This will output the configuration below
/system/servers
in curly braces format\&.
.sp
Note that when these environment variables are set, it means that the configuration will be loaded into the current CLI transaction (which must be in configure mode, and have AAA permissions to actually modify the config)\&. To load (or save) a file in a separate transaction, unset these two environment variables before invoking the
\fBncs\fR\fB_load\fR
command\&.
