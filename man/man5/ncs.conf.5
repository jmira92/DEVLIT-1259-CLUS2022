ncs.conf \- NCS daemon configuration file format
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Whenever we start (or reload) the NCS daemon it reads its configuration from
\&./ncs\&.conf
or
${NCS_DIR}/etc/ncs/ncs\&.conf
or from the file specified with the
\fB\-c\fR
option, as described in
\m[blue]\fBncs(1)\fR\m[]\&.
.PP
ncs\&.conf
is an XML configuration file formally defined by a YANG model,
tailf\-ncs\-config\&.yang
as referred to in the SEE ALSO section\&. This YANG file is included in the distribution\&. The NCS distribution also includes a commented ncs\&.conf\&.example file\&.
.PP
A short example: A NCS configuration file which specifies where to find fxs files etc, which facility to use for syslog, that the developer log should be disabled and that the audit log should be enabled\&. Finally, it also disables clear text NETCONF support:

.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/validate\-utf8/enabled (boolean) [false]
.RS 4
By default (false) NCS will not validate any data modeled as \*(Aqstring\*(Aq to be valid UTF\-8 and conform to yang\-string\&.
.sp
NOTE: String data from data providers and in the ncs\&.conf file itself are not validated\&.
.sp
The possibility to disable UTF\-8 validation is supplied because it can help in certain situations if there is data which is invalid UTF\-8 or does not conform to yang\-string\&. Disabling UTF\-8 and yang\-string validation allows invalid data input\&.
.sp
It is possible to check CDB contents for invalid UTF\-8 string data with the following
.sp
ncs \-\-cdb\-debug\-dump cdb\-dir validate_utf8
.sp
Invalid data will need to be corrected manually with UTF\-8 validation disabled\&.

/ncs\-config/ncs\-ipc\-address
.RS 4
NCS listens by default on 127\&.0\&.0\&.1:4569 for incoming TCP connections from NCS client libraries, such as CDB, MAAPI, the CLI, the external database API, as well as commands from the ncs script (such as \*(Aqncs \-\-reload\*(Aq)\&.
.sp
The IP address and port can be changed\&. If they are changed all clients using MAAPI, CDB et\&.c\&. must be re\-compiled to handle this\&. See the deployment user\-guide on how to do this\&.
.sp
Note that there are severe security implications involved if NCS is instructed to bind(2) to anything but localhost\&. Read more about this in the NCS IPC section in the System Managent Topics section of the User Guide\&. Use the IP 0\&.0\&.0\&.0 if you want NCS to listen(2) on all IPv4 addresses\&.
.sp
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/ncs\-ipc\-address/ip (ipv4\-address | ipv6\-address) [127\&.0\&.0\&.1]

.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/ncs\-ipc\-extra\-listen\-ip (ipv4\-address | ipv6\-address)
.RS 4
This parameter may be given multiple times\&.
.sp
A list of additional IPs to which we wish to bind the NCS IPC listener\&. This is useful if we don\*(Aqt want to use the wildcard 0\&.0\&.0\&.0 address in order to never expose the NCS IPC to certain interfaces\&.
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/ncs\-ipc\-access\-check
.RS 4
NCS can be configured to restrict access for incoming connections to the IPC listener sockets\&. The access check requires that connecting clients prove possession of a shared secret\&.
.sp
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/ncs\-ipc\-access\-check/enabled (boolean) [false]

If set to \*(Aqtrue\*(Aq, access check for IPC connections is enabled\&.
.RE

/ncs\-config/ncs\-ipc\-access\-check/filename (string)
.RS 4
This parameter is mandatory\&.
.sp
filename is the full path to a file containing the shared secret for the IPC access check\&. The file should be protected via OS file permissions, such that it can only be read by the NCS daemon and client processes that are allowed to connect to the IPC listener sockets\&.
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/enable\-shared\-memory\-schema (boolean) [true]
.RS 4
enabled is either true or false\&. If true, then a C program will be started that loads the schema into shared memory (which then can be accessed by e\&.g Python)
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/load\-path/dir (string)
.RS 4
This parameter may be given multiple times\&.
.sp
The load\-path element contains any number of dir elements\&. Each dir element points to a directory path on disk which is searched for compiled and imported YANG files (\&.fxs files) and compiled clispec files (\&.ccl files) during daemon startup\&. NCS also searches the load path for packages at initial startup, or when requested by the /packages/reload action\&.
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/enable\-compressed\-schema (boolean) [false]
.RS 4
If set to true, NCS\*(Aqs internal storage of the schema information from the \&.fxs files will be compressed\&. This will reduce the memory usage for large data models, but may also cause reduced performance when looking up the schema information\&. The trade off depends on the total amount of schema information and typical usage patterns, thus the effect should be evaluated before enabling this functionality\&.
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/compressed\-schema\-level (compressed\-schema\-level\-type) [1]
.RS 4
Controls the level of compression when enable\-compressed\-schema is set to true\&. Setting the value to 1 results in more aggressive compression at the cost of performance, 2 results in slightly less memory saved, but at higher performance\&.
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/state\-dir (string)
.RS 4
This parameter is mandatory\&.
.sp
This is where NCS writes persistent state data\&. Currently it is used to store a private copy of all packages found in the load path, in a directory tree rooted at \*(Aqpackages\-in\-use\&.cur\*(Aq (also referenced by a symlink \*(Aqpackages\-in\-use\*(Aq)\&. It is also used for the state files \*(Aqrunning\&.invalid\*(Aq, which exists only if the running database status is invalid, which it will be if one of the database implementation fails during the two\-phase commit protocol, and \*(Aqglobal\&.data\*(Aq which is used to store some data that needs to be retained across reboots\&.

/ncs\-config/notifications/event\-streams/stream/builtin\-replay\-store
.RS 4
Parameters for the built in replay store for this event stream\&.
.sp
If replay support is enabled NCS automatically stores all notifications on disk ready to be replayed should a NETCONF manager or RESTCONF event notification subscriber ask for logged notifications\&. The replay store uses a set of wrapping log files on disk (of a certain number and size) to store the notifications\&.
.sp
The max size of each wrap log file (see below) should not be too large\&. This to acheive fast replay of notifications in a certain time range\&. If possible use a larger number of wrap log files instead\&.

.sp
If a hide group does not have a hide\-group entry, then it cannot be unhidden using the CLI \*(Aqunhide\*(Aq command\&. However, it is possible to add a hide\-group entry to the ncs\&.conf file and then use ncs \-\-reload to make it available in the CLI\&. This may be useful to enable for example a diagnostics hide groups that you do not even want accessible using a password\&.
.RE

/ncs\-config/hide\-group/password (tailf:md5\-digest\-string) []
.RS 4
A password can optionally be specified for a hide group\&. If no password or callback is given then the hide group can be unhidden without giving a password\&.
.sp
If a password is specified then the hide group cannot be enabled unless the password is entered\&.
.sp
To completely disable a hide group, ie make it impossible to unhide it, remove the entire hide\-group container for that hide group\&.
.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/hide\-group/callback (string)
.RS 4
A callback can optionally be specified for a hide group\&. If no callback or password is given then the hide group can be unhidden without giving a password\&.

.RE
.PP
/ncs\-config/cdb/snapshot/pre\-populate (boolean) [false]
.RS 4
This parameter controls if the snapshot datastore should be pre\-populated during upgrade\&. Switching this on or off implies different trade\-offs\&.
.sp
If \*(Aqfalse\*(Aq, NCS is optimized for using normal transaction commits\&. The snapshot is populated in a lazy manner (when a device is committed through the commit queue for the first time)\&. The drawback is that this commit will suffer performance wise, which is especially true for devices with large configurations\&. Subsequent commits on the same devices will not have the same penalty\&.
.sp
If \*(Aqtrue\*(Aq, NCS is optimized for systems using the commit queue extensively\&.
