== Virtual MPLS Layer3 VPN Example

=== Example Overview

This is an extension to the mpls-VPN example and will only describe how
virtual routers are launched using ESC (Elastic Services Controller). Please
refer to the mpls-VPN example for details other than virtualization.

Caution! Please be advised that this example contains example NED's
and should not be used for production use.

==== Example Network

The example network consists of an MPLS network where layer3 VPN tunnels will
be provisioned.

The Layer3 VPN service configures the CE/PE routers for all endpoints
in the VPN. Virtual PE routers (vPE) are launched as they are requested by a CE
device configured to be on a virtual PE.

There is a list telling which CEs that are to be connected to a vPE. This information is preloaded into NSO:

----
onvpe [ ce7 ce8 ]
----

When a VPN is created with CE devices in the onvpe list a virtual device is
created. The virtual devices is named as <VPN name>_vpn_CSR_esc0. E.g.
volvo_vpn_CSR_esc0.

In this example all vPE:s will be connected to core router P3.

When a CE on a vPE is added as a VPN endpoint the corresponding topology
connections, P-vPE-CE, will be created as part of the service configuration.

The virtual device is added to the topology by allocating IP addresses from the
virtual_pe address pool and vlan link ids from the virtual_pe id pool:

----
show full-configuration resource-pools ip-address-pool virtual_pe
show full-configuration resource-pools id-pool virtual_pe
----

When creating the VPN it is possible to select an ESC template, to set what type
of router the vPE will be, by setting the esc_service references:

----
esc_service name vbranch-csr-service
esc_service version 1.0
esc_service vm_group CSR
----

For the service definitions please check the esc device. This configuration is
preloaded into ncs:
----
show full-configuration devices device esc0 config esc:esc_datamodel services
service_definition vbranch-csr-service 1.0
----


=== Running The Example in the CLI

Make sure you start clean, i.e. no old configuration data is present.
If you have been running this or some other example before, make sure
to stop any NCS or simulated network nodes (ncs-netsim) that you may have
running.  Output like 'connection refused (stop)' means no previous
NCS was running and 'DEVICE ce0 connection refused (stop)...' no
simulated network was running, which is good.

You may look at the service creation progress in the web log. Here you will see
the reactive fastmap service creation and re-deployments. Look at the log before
and after service creation and re-deployment:

----
do show logs web
----

Please read README.dev to get a better understanding what happens under hood:


----
make stop clean all start
ncs_cli -u admin -C
----

This will setup the environment and start the simulated network.


==== VPN Service Configuration in the CLI

Before creating a new L3VPN service we must sync the configuration
from all network devices and then enter config mode.

----
devices sync-from
----

Lets start by configuring a VPN network.

----
config
top
!
vpn l3vpn volvo
as-number 65101
endpoint main-office
ce-device    ce0
ce-interface GigabitEthernet0/1
ip-network   10.10.1.0/24
bandwidth    12000000
!
endpoint branch-office1
ce-device    ce1
ce-interface GigabitEthernet0/1
ip-network   10.7.7.0/24
bandwidth    6000000
!
endpoint branch-office2
ce-device    ce7
ce-interface GigabitEthernet0/1
ip-network   10.8.8.0/24
bandwidth    300000
!
esc_service name vbranch-csr-service
esc_service version 1.0
esc_service vm_group CSR
!
----

Before we send anything to the network, lets see what would be sent if
we committed.
----
commit dry-run outformat native
----

The output is too large to include here but as you can see each CE
device and the PE router it is connected to will be configured.
At this point the configuration of the vPE:s with connected CE:s are not
yet subject to be configured. They are future steps in the reactive fastmap
sequence.

Lets commit the configuration to the network

----
commit
----

At this point all physical PE:s with connected CE:s are configured and the vPE
is booted with a day0 configuration. The log informs that a service re-deploy
is needed to complete the VPN deployment.

Please look at the device modifications done so far. The output is too
big to be included here. Please notice the vm-manager/start part of
the configuration and the and the vm-manager/esc created as a result.

---
request vpn l3vpn get-modifications
request vm-service volvo_vpn_CSR get-modifications
---

If you are logged into the cli you will see the launched vPE in the l3vpn
topology map. The second part of the demo will create the connections to link
the P - vPE - CE together. You may add device ce7 to the map for the full
visualization of the link creation.

Re-deploy the service to proceed.

vpn l3vpn volvo re-deploy

=== Decommissioning VPNs

An important aspect in a service provider network is of course to be
able to decommission a VPN and be sure that all configured associated
with that VPN is cleaned up from the network, including the launched vPE:s.
This requires the deletion to be performed in two steps, to ensure that
the device configuration is deleted before the device it-self.

The process is as follows:
1. vpn l3vpn volvo is removed, includes the vm-start request
2. removal of vm-start request is detected by the vm-manager and 
   the vm-service instance is removed
3. removal of the vm-service instance removes the esc tenant
4. removal of the esc tenent stops the virtual router

----
top
no vpn l3vpn volvo
----

Lets test this with one of our VPNs and see what would happen to the
network.

----
commit dry-run outformat cli
----

All is good and our VPN configuration is removed from the network.
Lets commit the changes.
