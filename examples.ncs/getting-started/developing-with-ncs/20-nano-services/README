This example illustrates how to design a Reactive FASTMAP service
using Nano Services.

To declare a Nano service three things are necessary in the service
YANG model.

1. The service must include the grouping

   uses ncs:nano-plan-data;

   This is an augmented variant of the ncs:plan-data that is extended
   to make the plan executable. The grouping ncs:plan-data cannot be
   used for a nano Service.

2. There must be a plan definition declared with a ncs:plan-outline
   statement in the YANG module.

3. There must be a service behavior tree declared with a
   ncs:service-behavior-tree statement in the YANG module.


The ncs:plan-outline statement creates a plan definition with a given name,
and contains a description of the possible component-types and their
states that the service plan instance will use.  Note that an
instantiated service can have a plan with zero, one or many different
components based on the same component type.

It is the responsibility of the ncs:service-behavior-tree to create the
plan components that are included in the instantiated service plan at
all times. For this the ncs:service-behavior-tree consists of a tree of rules
for when a component is added or removed from the service instance
plan.

The package link defines a link Nano service setting up a vpn link.
The service has a list containing at most 1 element which constitutes
the vpn link and is keyed on a-device a-interface b-device b-interface
The list element will correspond to a component type "link:vlan-link"
in the plan.



---- Plan definition ----


The following is the Nano service plan definition:

  identity vlan-link {
    base ncs:plan-component-type;
  }

  identity dev-setup {
    base ncs:plan-state;
  }

  ncs:plan-outline link-plan {
    description
      "Make before brake vlan plan";

    ncs:component-type "ncs:self" {
      ncs:state "ncs:init";
      ncs:state "ncs:ready";
    }

    ncs:component-type "link:vlan-link" {
      ncs:state "ncs:init";
      ncs:state "link:dev-setup" {
        ncs:create {
          ncs:nano-callback;
        }
      }
      ncs:state "ncs:ready" {
        ncs:create {
          ncs:monitor "{$SERVICE}/endpoints" {
            ncs:trigger-expr "current()[test-passed = 'true']";
          }
        }
        ncs:delete {
          ncs:monitor "{$SERVICE}/plan" {
            ncs:trigger-expr "boolean(current()/component[name != 'self']
                [./back-track = 'false']/state[name='ncs:ready']
                [./status = 'reached']) or
                not(current()/component[back-track = 'false'])";
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }


To be noted in the plan definition is the following.
There is only one Nano service callback registered for the service.
This is on the "link:dev-setup" state in the "link:vlan-link"
component type.
This is represented in the plan as:
      ncs:state "link:dev-setup" {
        ncs:create {
          ncs:nano-callback;
        }
      }
The callback is a template and can be found under packages/link/templates as
link-template.xml.

For the state "ncs:ready in the "link:vlan-link" component type there
are both a create and a delete pre-condition.
The create pre-condition
        ncs:create {
          ncs:monitor "{$SERVICE}/endpoints" {
            ncs:trigger-expr "current()[test-passed = 'true']";
          }
        }
implies that the components based on this component type will not
be regarded as finished until the test-passed leaf is set to "true".
This will illustrate the scenario that after initial setup of a link
is configured by the "link:dev-setup" state a manual test and setting
of the test-passed leaf is necessary before the link is regarded as
finished.

The delete pre-condition
        ncs:delete {
          ncs:monitor "{$SERVICE}/plan" {
            ncs:trigger-expr "boolean(current()/component[name != 'self']
                [./back-track = 'false']/state[name='ncs:ready']
                [./status = 'reached']) or
                not(current()/component[back-track = 'false'])";
          }
        }
implies that before starting to delete ("back-tracking") an old
component, then all new components must have reached the "ncs:ready"
state i.e. being tested.
This is to illustrate a "create-before-break" scenario where the new
link is created first and only when this is setup the old is removed.


---- Behavior tree definition ----

The ncs:service-behavior-tree for the example is the following:

  ncs:service-behavior-tree link-servicepoint {
    description
      "Make before brake vlan example";

    ncs:plan-outline-ref link-plan;

    ncs:selector {
      ncs:create-component "'self'" {
        ncs:component-type-ref "ncs:self";
      }

      ncs:multiplier {
        ncs:foreach "endpoints" {
          ncs:variable "LINKNAME" {
            ncs:value-expr "concat(a-device, '-',
                                   a-interface, '-',
                                   b-device, '-',
                                   b-interface)";
          }
        }
        ncs:create-component "$LINKNAME" {
          ncs:component-type-ref "link:vlan-link";
        }
      }
    }

Here the the ncs:service-behavior-tree is registered on the servicepoint
"link-servicepoint" defined by the Nano service. It refers to the plan
definition named "link:link-plan".
The behavior tree has a selector on top which chooses to synthesize it
children depending on their pre-conditions, in this tree there are no
pre-conditions so all children will be synthesized.

First there is a component "self" based on the "ncs:self" component
type in the plan that is always synthesized.

Second there is a "multiplier" control node that selects a node-set
create a variable named VALUE with a unique value for each node in
that node-set and creates a component of type "link:vlan-link" for
each node in the selected node-set. The name for each individual
component is the value of the variable VALUE.

Since the selected node-set is the "endpoints" list that can contain
at most one element this will produce only one component.
However if the link in the service is changed i.e. the old list entry
is deleted and a new is created then the multiplier will create a
component with a new name.

This will force the old component (which no longer is synthesized) to
be back-tracked and the plan definition above will handle the
"create-before-break" behavior of this back-tracking.



---- Running the example ----
To run the example do the following:

$ make all

$ ncs-netsim restart

$ ncs

$ ncs_cli -C -u admin

admin@ncs# devices sync-from
sync-result {
    device ex0
    result true
}
sync-result {
    device ex1
    result true
}
sync-result {
    device ex2
    result true
}


admin@ncs# config
Entering configuration mode terminal


admin@ncs(config)# link t2 unit 17 vlan-id 1
admin@ncs(config-link-t2)# link t2 endpoints ex1 eth0 ex2 eth0 test-passed true
admin@ncs(config-endpoints-ex1/eth0/ex2/eth0)# commit
admin@ncs(config-endpoints-ex1/eth0/ex2/eth0)# top

This will create a service that is setup a vpn link between devices
ex1 and ex2 and is completed immediately since the test-passed
leaf is set to true.

We can inspect the result of the commit

admin@ncs(config)# exit
admin@ncs# link t2 get-modifications
cli  devices {
          device ex1 {
              config {
                  r:sys {
                      interfaces {
                          interface eth0 {
     +                        unit 17 {
     +                            vlan-id 1;
     +                        }
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
          device ex2 {
              config {
                  r:sys {
                      interfaces {
                          interface eth0 {
     +                        unit 17 {
     +                            vlan-id 1;
     +                        }
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }

The service setup the link between the devices.
We inspect the plan:

admin@ncs# show link t2 plan component * state * status
NAME               STATE      STATUS
---------------------------------------
self               init       reached
                   ready      reached
ex1-eth0-ex2-eth0  init       reached
                   dev-setup  reached
                   ready      reached

All components in the plan has reached its ready state.

Now we change the link by changing the interface on one of the
devices. To do this we must remove the old list entry in "endpoints"
and create a new one.

admin@ncs# config
Entering configuration mode terminal
admin@ncs(config)# no link t2 endpoints ex1 eth0 ex2 eth0
admin@ncs(config)# link t2 endpoints ex1 eth0 ex2 eth1

We commit dry-run to inspect what will happen

admin@ncs(config-endpoints-ex1/eth0/ex2/eth1)# commit dry-run
cli  devices {
         device ex1 {
             config {
                 r:sys {
                     interfaces {
                         interface eth0 {
                         }
                     }
                 }
             }
         }
         device ex2 {
             config {
                 r:sys {
                     interfaces {
    +                    interface eth1 {
    +                        unit 17 {
    +                            vlan-id 1;
    +                        }
    +                    }
                     }
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     link t2 {
    -    endpoints ex1 eth0 ex2 eth0 {
    -        test-passed true;
    -    }
    +    endpoints ex1 eth0 ex2 eth1 {
    +    }
     }


The service will at commit just add the new interface at this point
and not remove anything. This is because the test-passed leaf will not
be set to "true" for the new component.
We commit this change and inspect the plan

admin@ncs(config-endpoints-ex1/eth0/ex2/eth1)# commit
admin@ncs(config-endpoints-ex1/eth0/ex2/eth1)# top
admin@ncs(config)# exit
admin@ncs# show link t2 plan

show link t2 plan
                                                                   ...
                              BACK                                 ...
NAME               TYPE       TRACK  GOAL  STATE      STATUS       ...
-------------------------------------------------------------------...
self               self       false  -     init       reached      ...
                                           ready      reached      ...
ex1-eth0-ex2-eth1  vlan-link  false  -     init       reached      ...
                                           dev-setup  reached      ...
                                           ready      not-reached  ...
ex1-eth0-ex2-eth0  vlan-link  true   -     init       reached      ...
                                           dev-setup  reached      ...
                                           ready      reached      ...

We see that the new component 'ex1-eth0-ex2-eth1' has not reached
its ready state yet. Therefore the old component 'ex1-eth0-ex2-eth0'
still exists in back-track mode but is still waiting for the
new component to finish.



If we check what the service has configured at this point we get the
following:
admin@ncs# link t2 get-modifications
cli  devices {
          device ex1 {
              config {
                  r:sys {
                      interfaces {
                          interface eth0 {
     +                        unit 17 {
     +                            vlan-id 1;
     +                        }
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
          device ex2 {
              config {
                  r:sys {
                      interfaces {
                          interface eth0 {
     +                        unit 17 {
     +                            vlan-id 1;
     +                        }
                          }
     +                    interface eth1 {
     +                        unit 17 {
     +                            vlan-id 1;
     +                        }
     +                    }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }

So both the old and the new link exists at this point.
Now we set the test-passed leaf to true to force the new
component to reach its ready state.

admin@ncs(config)# link t2 endpoints ex1 eth0 ex2 eth1 test-passed true
admin@ncs(config-endpoints-ex1/eth0/ex2/eth1)# commit


If we now check the service plan we see the following:


admin@ncs(config-endpoints-ex1/eth0/ex2/eth1)# top
admin@ncs(config)# exit
admin@ncs# show link t2 plan
                                                               ...
                              BACK                             ...
NAME               TYPE       TRACK  GOAL  STATE      STATUS   ...
---------------------------------------------------------------...
self               self       false  -     init       reached  ...
                                           ready      reached  ...
ex1-eth0-ex2-eth1  vlan-link  false  -     init       reached  ...
                                           dev-setup  reached  ...
                                           ready      reached  ...

So the old component has been completely back-tracked and is removed
because the new component is finished. We also check the service
modifications and see that the old link endpoint is removed


admin@ncs# link t2 get-modifications
cli  devices {
          device ex1 {
              config {
                  r:sys {
                      interfaces {
                          interface eth0 {
     +                        unit 17 {
     +                            vlan-id 1;
     +                        }
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
          device ex2 {
              config {
                  r:sys {
                      interfaces {
     +                    interface eth1 {
     +                        unit 17 {
     +                            vlan-id 1;
     +                        }
     +                    }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
